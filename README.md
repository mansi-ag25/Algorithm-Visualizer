# Algorithm-Visualizer


#About

The project "Algorithm Visualizer" talks about the visualization of different searching and 
sorting algorithms. The searching algorithm used in this project are linear search and binary search.
and the sorting algorithms that are used are- bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, 
merge sort and quick sort. The visualization is done in the form of bar graphs where the bar graph 
visualizes all the searching and sorting algos.
